# ðŸš€ FullStack DevTool

FullStack DevTool is an entirely new type of interactive console that aggregates and **displays logs from multiple source applications** in an organized manner. Previously, a developer working on multiple interdependent applications had to split their attention across multiple interfaces to monitor all the logs. With **FullStack DevTool**, they can now track, organize, and filter them through a single, optimized interface.

FullStack DevTool also holds value for developers working on a single application at a time, as they can benefit from an unprecedented log management system (interactive log categorization, filtering, sorting, etc.).

With FullStack DevTool, there's no need to delete logs once development is complete. You can keep them, as they will never be visible in production and can be easily sorted as needed.
